This repository hosts my public cybersecurity portfolio.

It serves as an entry point for recruiters and hiring teams and links to my
hands-on technical labs, which document foundational IT and system administration
skills required for entry-level cybersecurity roles.

Lab repositories:

A. Cybersecurity-labs
IN PROGRESS

B. IT-Fundamentals-Labs
  https://github.com/GiBoris/IT-Fundamentals-Labs

All labs are performed in isolated, non-production environments and are documented
with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and real-world relevance.
