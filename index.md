# Boris — Cybersecurity Portfolio (Entry-Level SOC / Blue Team)

I’m building job-ready cybersecurity skills through hands-on labs and clear documentation.
This site is my public portfolio for recruiters and hiring teams.

**Core focus:** SIEM (Splunk), Windows security events, network traffic analysis, incident response workflows.

---

## Featured Projects

### 1) SOC Investigation Case Studies (Splunk + Windows Logs)
**Goal:** Detect and investigate suspicious authentication behavior (brute force, password spraying, impossible travel).  
**Tools:** Splunk, Windows Event Logs, Sysmon (optional)  
**What I deliver:** detection logic, SPL queries, investigation notes, screenshots  
**Evidence:** *(add link to folder/repo and 1–2 screenshots)*

**Link:** [SOC Investigations (repo/folder)](./)  

---

### 2) Network Traffic Analysis (PCAP → Findings)
**Goal:** Identify suspicious DNS / HTTP patterns and document findings like a real analyst.  
**Tools:** Wireshark, PCAPs, basic threat intel checks  
**What I deliver:** indicators, timeline, conclusions, recommended mitigations  

**Link:** [Network Analysis (repo/folder)](./)

---

### 3) Incident Response Playbooks (Entry-Level)
**Goal:** Build simple, practical playbooks (triage → containment → eradication → recovery).  
**Tools:** Markdown playbooks, checklists, basic tooling  
**What I deliver:** repeatable steps, decision points, evidence to collect  

**Link:** [IR Playbooks (repo/folder)](./)

## Splunk Commands (separate repo)
A growing “quick reference” of basic **Splunk SPL commands**, fields, and common SOC queries.

**Link:** [Splunk Commands Repository](https://github.com/GiBoris/Splunk-Commands)
> If the repo doesn’t exist yet, create it later and keep this link as-is (or update the name).

## Skills Snapshot

**Blue Team / SOC**
- Alert triage, investigation notes, escalation-ready summaries
- Windows authentication & security event analysis
- Basic detection engineering mindset (reduce noise, validate signals)

**Technical**
- Splunk SPL (search, stats, timechart, eval, rex, lookup basics)
- PCAP analysis (filters, protocol behaviors, anomalies)
- Windows logs (Security log, Sysmon where applicable)

---

## Lab Standards (what reviewers can expect)
- Clear objective and scope for each lab
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots or output evidence
- “What I learned” + “What I’d do in production”

---

## About This Portfolio
This portfolio is intentionally practical and targeted at an **entry-level cybersecurity role**.

**Disclaimer:** All labs use simulated, test, or anonymized data. No credentials, sensitive data, or proprietary logs are included.
